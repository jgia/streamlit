Description: This program uses Streamlit to display 5 maps/charts/graphs. The first is an interactive map of each NCAA stadium and their respective capacities
using pydeck. The next is a bar chart of the average stadium capacity by NCAA conference. The user can use checkboxes to select which NCAA conferences to include
in the barchart. Next, a scatter plot shows the relationship between stadium date built and stadium capacity. The user can use a double ended slider to select
the range of years for the scatter plot x-axis. The barchart and scatter plot are both created using the matplotlib library, but the next two charts use plotly
to show the number of NCAA stadiums per state and average capacity of NCAA stadiums by state. When states are shaded with darker colors, they have more stadiums
or a higher average stadium capacity. Plotly takes state abbreviations instead of state names to create these charts, so I used the us library to convert each
state name to its abbreviation.
